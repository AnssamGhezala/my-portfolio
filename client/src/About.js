          I like reading stuff about the web dev industry, and am curious about
          anything related it. Although I am currently learning the core
          computer science/software engineering topics at McGill, most of the
          web-dev related skills that I have achieved are self-taught. I love
          the Web and I want to be able to contribute to it, which is why I hope
          to get an internship or a part-time position in front-end related
          positions :){" "}
